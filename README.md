# Sentiment Analysis using Allen NLP

Came across Allen NLP while watching deep learning state of the art 2019 video by [Lex Fridman](https://deeplearning.mit.edu/). Tried playing with the library on google colab and referred to http://www.realworldnlpbook.com/blog/training-sentiment-analyzer-using-allennlp.html for his sentiment analysis post. Checkout the tutorials from [Allen NLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/tree/master/tutorials). 

My next step ideally would be to figure out a way to save and load model as well as to serialize it into pytorch or tensorflow model. If anyone feels interested in the same, I'd appreciate a pull request.
